# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

## üå± Project Overview
This project aims to **predict crop yields** based on farming practices (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer use) and environmental factors (e.g., soil type, season) using machine learning. It helps farmers and policymakers optimize resource allocation and improve agricultural sustainability.

## üìå Key Objectives
1. **Predict Crop Yield**: Accurately forecast yield (in tons) for different crops.
2. **Identify Key Factors**: Determine which variables (e.g., water usage, farm area) most impact yield.
3. **Support Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights for farmers to reduce costs and improve productivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Components
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Handled Missing Values**: Imputed numerical/categorical data.
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Scaled numerical features (e.g., `Farm_Area`).  
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., `Crop_Type`, `Soil_Type`).  
- **Train-Validation-Test Split**: 70%-15%-15%.

### 2. **Model Development**
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (chosen for handling mixed data types and robustness to overfitting).  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized `n_estimators` and `max_depth` using `GridSearchCV`.

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **R¬≤ Score**: Measures variance explained by the model (target: close to 1).  
- **RMSE**: Quantifies prediction errors in yield units (tons).  

### 4. **Deployment & Monitoring**
- **API**: Flask app for real-time predictions (e.g., `POST /predict`).  
- **Concept Drift Detection**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to monitor data distribution shifts over time.
