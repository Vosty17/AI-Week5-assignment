    "## What is concept drift? How would you monitor it post-deployment?\n",
    "**Definition:** Shift in data distribution (e.g., climate change altering yield patterns) post-deployment.\n",
    "**Monitoring:** Track model performance decay over time using a small held-out dataset or statistical tests\n",
    "## Describe 1 technical challenge during deployment (e.g., scalability).\n",
    "**Scalability:** Handling real-time data from thousands of farms may require cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS SageMaker) for distributed computing."
